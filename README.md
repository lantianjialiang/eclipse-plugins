===============

Eclipse plugins which I create is putting here
---
1. xpath Ctrl+2 to copy selection resource path to clipboard 
2. alarm to alarm you rest when you work for a long time 
3. t4eclipse

update site:
Because github can not take as a update site, 
so if you want to using those plugins, please got 
update site to your locat disk with git, then enjoy it.

Note: t4eclipse is not support eclipse 3.x from now on. if you want to using it
in eclipse 3.x, please goto http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/t4eclipse/downloads/list.

If you want to contribute to t4eclipse, please fork me.

Thanks.
