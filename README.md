eclipse-plugins
===============

Eclipse plugins which I create is putting here
---
1. xpath Ctrl+2 to copy selection resource path to clipboard 
2. alarm to alarm you rest when you work for a long time 
3. t4eclipse

update site:
Because github can not take as a update site, 
so if you want to using those plugins, please got 
update site to your locat disk with git, then enjoy it.

Thanks.
